# MD5_Message_Digest

## About MD5
* MD5 was designed as a strengthened version of MD4, prior to actual MD4 collisions being found.
* MD5 is obtained from MD4 by making modifications.
* These changes will be outlined in this project where implemented.
* MD5 operates on 32-bit words.

## Program Execution
* Ensure you have gcc installed on machine
* To Compile program, run: 
* `$ make md5`
* To Run program, run:
* `./md5 <file_name>`
